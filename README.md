## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to accurately estimate house prices. The insights derived from this model can assist real estate agents, buyers, and sellers in making informed decisions.


## Business Understanding

House prices vary due to a wide range of factors such as location, size, amenities, and economic conditions. This project’s objective is to:

Identify the most influential factors impacting house prices.
Develop a model to predict prices based on these factors.


## Data Understanding

The dataset contains various features that describe different aspects of properties. Here’s a summary of some key attributes:

Numerical Features: Lot Area, GrLivArea, OverallQual, OverallCond, etc.
Categorical Features: Neighborhood, HouseStyle, Exterior, etc.
Target Variable: SalePrice (the actual house price to predict).


## Data Source
Provide the data source if publicly available or add a description of how the dataset can be accessed.

## Preprocessing

Describe any preprocessing steps taken, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A thorough analysis was conducted to understand relationships in the data:

Correlation Analysis: Identified strong correlations between features like GrLivArea, OverallQual, and SalePrice.

Distribution Analysis: Examined distributions of important features and the target variable.

Outlier Detection: Detected and handled outliers where necessary.


## Modeling

Multiple models were trained and evaluated to find the best-performing one. Models include:

Baseline Model: Linear regression.

Advanced Models:


Neural Network

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

XGBoost

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).


## Results

Best Performing Model: Include the model name, MAE, RMSE, and R².


## Key Insights:

Highlight any significant findings, like the most important features affecting house prices.


## Conclusion and Future Work

Summarize the model's performance and suggest potential improvements or extensions:

Feature Engineering: Add or refine features based on domain knowledge.
Model Optimization: Experiment with other algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
Deployment: Consider deploying the model in a web app for real-time predictions.
